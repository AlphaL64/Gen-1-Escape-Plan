# MonConverter
This is an arbitrary code execution program for pokémon Red and Blue (english version) on the GameBoy.
When executed, it will read the data for the pokémon in your current box, and then write it to the screen by changing the tile data to the data read from the box.
# Usage
This is still a work in progress. Currently, you can execute the program and grab the code but, unless you are willing to manually transcribe the data from the code to the conversion program, you won't be able to convert it to a file.
If you want tohugh, just download the executable and do as it says.
